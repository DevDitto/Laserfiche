## What is Tettra?

Tettra is a place to store our team's collective knowledge. It allows us to document any process, resource, or guideline that helps us get our jobs done on a daily basis. It's a living, breathing platform where everyone can contribute to document important knowledge as our team grows.

## Why do we need it?

As teams grow it gets harder and harder to keep information flowing between teams. Knowledge silos naturally build up and it gets difficult to keep everyone in the loop. Creating a culture of sharing knowledge can help us make better decisions faster, because everyone will have the knowledge they need.

### Example content

- HR Information
- Customer Support FAQs
- Processes
- Technical documentation

## Notable Features

### Editor

Tettra's editor is simple to learn and use so everyone can contribute content. You can embed images, videos, tables, and do simple page formatting. Pages can be organized into categories and folders. For more details on the editor, [check out the documentation here](http://support.tettra.co/editor/page-editor-overview).

### Slack integration

Since so much knowledge already gets shared in chat everyday, Tettra is deeply integrated with Slack. You can search for and share Tettra pages within Slack with a slash command by typing `/tettra find [search term]` in a channel. [More details here](http://support.tettra.co/integrations).

### Suggestions

Tettra also has a built-in way for you to suggest new pages as well as updates to existing content. If you see anything missing or out of date, [feel free to create a suggestion](http://support.tettra.co/suggestions/page-suggestions).

### Zapier integration

There's also a zapier integration that can automate the creation of new pages. For example, if you have a weekly meeting you want to document, you can set that up in Zapier to automatically [create the page before the meeting](http://support.tettra.co/integrations/zapier-integration/tettra-zapier-workflow-ideas).
